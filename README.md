##Empower your customer to start a seamless returns process.
A multi-language and multi-shop return registration function in the front-end of your Magento shop for a controlled start of the returns process. The return module is accessible from My Account and can also be used without user account. Different return types (commercial, warranty) can be set up with unique return settings. The customer can specify the desired exchange product or ask for a voucher in stead of a refund. Based on the return type and origin of the customer the allowed return options will be presented. The label from the appropriate carrier is presented for download or printing. Customers can simply follow the status of the end-to-end returns process in My Account.
