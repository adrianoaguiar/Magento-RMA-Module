##Starter version

The FREE starter version for Magento Community offers an "install and go" solution including following logistics features:
(1) Self postage and send by the customer is the most simple return option. You don’t need a carrier contract for it and it can be used in every country. The customer receives a clear return label with the RMA number in barcode to send the return (e.g. via the local postal office). Despite there is no track & trace integration with a carrier, this solution offers many advantages in combination with the RMA Module. As the return has been registered you know that it is returning. And the status of the returns processing is visible to the customer. The RMA Module enables you to offer a controlled returns process with this commonly used return option.
(2) Warehouse returns handling can be done in the Magento backend with the "internal processing" option. All RMAs that have been checked in are directly available in the standard Credit Memo for restock and refund. Internal processing offers you a "just-2-clicks" RMA process in your Magento admin panel.
